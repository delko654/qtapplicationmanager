\title Qt Application Manager

\section1 Overview

The application-manager binary (\c appman) is a headless daemon by itself. A suitable QML file
needs to be supplied on the command-line or via a config file at startup, which will act as a
compositing window manager using the APIs that are exported from the C++ side.

Please read the \l{The Qt Application Manager}{Introduction to the Qt Application Manager} for a
high-level overview of the package.
