\title Writing Applications

Writing an application that can be run as a client within the application-manager is not that
much different from writing a stand-alone QML application. It basically boils down to three
additional tasks:

\list 1

    \li If you write a QML application, make the root element of your QML scene an
    ApplicationManagerWindow (or derive your own custom root item from it).

    \li Provide a valid \l{Manifest definition}{info.yaml} file.

    \li Make the application-manager aware of your application by running \c{appman
    --recreate-database}.

\endlist

\section2 The Root Element

It is recommended to use either an ApplicationManagerWindow or a QtObject as the root of your QML
application. This is especially important, if you expect similar behavior in single- and
multi-process mode. If a QtObject is used, visible base elements should still be
\l{ApplicationManagerWindow}{ApplicationManagerWindows}. Nevertheless other root elements are
supported for convenience, as well. Here are a few things to consider:
\list
    \li Only \l{ApplicationManagerWindow}{ApplicationManagerWindows} support window properties
        that are shared between the System-UI and the client applications.
    \li In multi-porcess mode \l Window root elements will get a decoration (unless
        QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION is set) and will be invisible by default. QQuick
        \l{Item}{Items} will be wrapped inside a \l Window representing a Wayland client window.
    \li In single-process mode \l Window root elements will appear parallel to instead of inside
        the System-UI.
\endlist

\section2 The Manifest and Updating the Database

The \l{Manifest Definition} documentation has all the information to produce a minimal \c info.yaml
file that should get you going.

Recursively finding and parsing \c info.yaml files for potentially hundreds of applications can
be a very time consuming task and would severely slow down application-manager's
startup. Therefore, all manifest files are cached in a binary database. In order to make changes
to an \c info.yaml file known to the application-manager, you have to force a rebuild of this
database by calling \c{appman --recreate-database}.

\note Dynamically adding/updating/removing single applications is supported via the
ApplicationInstaller interface.
